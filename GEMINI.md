# GEMINI Agent Instructions

This directory and its subdirectories are designated for the Gemini agent's autonomous operation. The agent is granted full permission to execute commands, modify files, and manage the project as needed to fulfill user requests.

## Agent's Operational Scope:

-   **File System Access**: Full read, write, and delete permissions within this directory.
-   **Command Execution**: Ability to run any shell commands necessary for development, testing, and deployment.
-   **Git Operations**: Permission to perform Git operations (add, commit, push) as required.
-   **Tool Usage**: Unrestricted use of all available tools (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`, `replace`, `glob`, `search_file_content`, `web_fetch`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`).

This file serves as a clear directive for the Gemini agent to operate with the necessary autonomy to complete tasks efficiently and effectively.
